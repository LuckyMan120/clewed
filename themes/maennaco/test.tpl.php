            We believe the traditional private equity alternative is too short-term, costly and risky for promising smaller companies with immense potential to grow sustainably in today’s complex environment.

<b>Maenna</b> offers a new owner-friendly approach. Instead of investing in companies we sell in 3-5 years, we buy equity to hold and compound earnings growth over decades from market share expansion of the businesses we partner with. For companies that meet our criteria, we provide services to help solve key resource challenges for growth and to build relationships for a long-term partnership. Our service platform integrates talented analysts, executives and professionals – who share information, expertise and time – with companies they potentially can invest in. Our mission is to create a trusted partnership where talent works collaboratively with owners to build leading companies and grow wealth. We sell limited shares to enable flexible liquidity with minimum transaction costs and business interruption. Contact us to learn more or apply.
