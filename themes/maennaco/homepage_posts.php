We research ideas and analyze companies and markets to track the distinct competitive
advantage of quality businesses across sectors. Using our research, we perform a
thorough due diligence of our clients to identify the unique characteristics that will
drive their long-term growth. Based on our diligence, we tailor an advisory council
of professionals to integrate new ideas and expertise to maximize equity value. To
make this possible, we created an innovative, patent pending tool that allows busy
professionals to advise companies in the most efficient way possible, by focusing only
on their specific specialty. Our platform organizes our in-depth research, as well as the
latest and most relevant company progress, so that advisors are well informed about
clients without wasting time on gathering information.

<span class="dialog-right-column-title">What We Believe</span><br><br>

We believe small to mid-size companies have the highest unrecognized potential and
must connect more seamlessly with leading owner-minded professionals to realize their
long-term potential. We created our platform to allow clients to compound maximum
growth for as long as possible because doing so generates far greater wealth than any
short-term fix.<br><br>

<span class="dialog-right-column-title">What Sets Us Apart</span><br><br>

The expertise we offer our clients has never before been organized and made
accessible and affordable to small and midsize companies. Traditionally, significant
scale inefficiencies prevented top professionals from serving this market. Our system
makes it worthwhile for talented professionals to commit their time for the opportunity to
engage in rewarding projects and potentially invest and grow with promising companies
they help to build with owner incentives.

Through our services, we seek to build trust with clients and become a preferred long-term equity partner. Our investment strategy is to identify lesser known quality companies early on to compound high growth for a long time horizon. We believe our strategy enables qualified companies to access capital efficiently while aligning the interests of our investors with owners who desire to grow their business with a longer-term perspective. We don't get paid to provide capital to our companies or to manage money for our investors; our economic interest is fully aligned with the growth of the companies we serve. Our specialty is developing creative ideas, applying expertise and maximizing growth with minimal interruption. Instead of exist strategies, we focus on building companies any investor would want to keep by actively growing businesses and managing risks through our advisory process.
<br><br><span class = "dialog-right-column-subtitle">INVESTOR LIQUIDITY</span></br>
clewed will organize liquidity events to enable its members to sell pieces of their ownership as needed. We first facilitate exits within our member group and seek to reduce transaction costs to maximize the benefits of compound interest for the remaining owners.

We believe our approach attracts owner-minded quality companies seeking a trusted, long-term partner to realize their full potential and relies on the power of compound interest to generate superior net long-term returns. This enables investors to access less known promising companies proprietarily, outside of an expensive auction process. Our business model is not ruled by annual fees and exits but by the sustainable growth of companies in which we invest. We measure our performance against the performance of competitive public or private investment opportunities. Our process minimizes transaction costs for investors and allows owners to maximize value with minimum interruption. Our incentives are fully aligned with that of business owners and long-term investors. As such, we don't charge annual investment management fee but seek to take a 25% share of the profits we generate for investors.
