<h1 class="about-company-h1">Short Summary</h1>
<p>Investors fund ideas that they believe will generate better returns than alternative opportunities and that they clearly understand the risks and return expectations. They need to trust the character and ability of the people to deliver results.Â They also prefer investments where they make an impact. Here are some things to include in this section:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Briefly describe the economic potential of your investment opportunity </li>
  <li> Express what milestones the money you receive will help you achieve </li>
  <li> Describe what your solution is, for whom and why it is unique / your competitive advantage </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, keep it concise. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make an investment?</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h1 class="about-company-h1">The Market</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Break down the total size of the specific sub-market you play in </li>
  <li> Discuss the growth potential </li>
  <li> Discuss your priority markets and why </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<h1 class="about-company-h1">The Impact</h1>
<p>Feel free to explain more about the opportunity and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain why your project is valuable to the investors and to the world </li>
  <li> Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). </li>
  <li> Make it real for people and build trust </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<h1 class="about-company-h1">Risks and Mitigants</h1>
<p>People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal and how you mitigate each risk:</p>
<ul>
  <li> List each risk item separately to discuss what it is (eg: market risk, operational risk, technology, growth, other uncontrollable risks etc.) </li>
  <li> After each risk, describe how you will mitigate the risk </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<h1 class="about-company-h1">Other ways you can help</h1>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your opportunity </li>
  <li> Remind them to use the share tools associated with your project </li>
</ul>
