    <span class="dialog-right-column-title">Our Story</span><br><br>
    Working in private equity, Clewed's founder, Hiwot Nega, realized that the typical partnership vehicles available for businesses are optimized for short-term exits, rather than for building lasting companies. So, she created Clewed.
    <br><br>
    Clewed believes the world’s top business professionals can be better connected with small to midsize companies to help owners more easily realize their long-term potential. We’ve built a service platform that enables many capable professionals to privately advise companies in their areas of expertise while sharing their research and knowledge on shared topics with a group of companies.
    <br><br>
    We are an early stage technology enabled start up with one mission: to bring together companies and business professionals to build great businesses for the long term. Our platform provides a standardized process for the world’s top industry operators, analysts as well as subject matter experts to engage with small to midsize companies efficiently on one platform. Over time, we expect our platform to enable companies to access capital in owner friendly terms – from the people who help them build and like-minded long-term investors.

    The expertise Clewed offers has never before been this accessible or affordable to small and midsize companies. Traditionally, scale inefficiencies prevented top professionals from serving this market. Our streamlined system makes it worthwhile for talented professionals to commit their time to engage and invest in promising companies they help to build.

    We provide specialized management services using a network of leading industry and operating professionals.
    <br><br>
    We work as if we are part owners of the businesses we serve. Our management services combine a comprehensive diligence and research focused on identifying the unique characteristics and market opportunities that will drive our client’s long-term growth.

    <br><br>
    Driven by a long-term, growth-compounding strategy, Clewed has developed a company management and monitoring system that organizes in-depth company research, including the latest, most relevant company progress and shares this knowledge privately with a network of professionals advising that company – all on a need to know basis and following confidentiality procedures. This helps professionals to focus on their areas of expertise without wasting time to gather company information independently.  This process makes it easy for Clewed to attract leading professionals otherwise hard to access for its Clients due to the traditional inefficiencies to access experts in an otherwise fragmented market.

    Clewed’s approach attracts owner-minded quality companies seeking a trusted, long-term partner to realize their full potential. We rely on the power of compound interest to generate superior long-term net returns. This enables investors to access promising lesser–known companies proprietarily, outside of an expensive auction process.
    <br><br>
    Our business model is not ruled by annual fees and exits but instead by the sustainable growth of companies in which we invest. We measure our performance against the performance of competitive public or private investment opportunities. Our process minimizes transaction costs for investors and allows owners to maximize value with minimum interruption.
    <br><br>
    Our incentives are fully aligned with those of business owners and long-term investors. As such, we don't charge annual investment management fees, but instead seek a 25% share of the profits we generate for investors.
