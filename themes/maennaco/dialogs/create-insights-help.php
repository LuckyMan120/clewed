    <p>You can list an Insight to share your research or knowledge with a group of business people or list a 
        Service to help individual buyers or companies privately in your area of expertise. 
        Topics should be privileged and actionable not available publicly. How it works:</p>

    <p style="font-family: Lato Black;margin-bottom: 16px;color:#00A3BF">1. Submit Your Topic</p>

    <p>Using the “Create Insights or Services” tool, submit your topic. A) Select a brief title, describe the types of
        people and companies your topic targets, what buyers will get, and price it. B) Enable the 
        discount feature so you can invite people easily later, C) For Insights, upload a power point 
        visual aid that helps the audience prepare and ask questions as soon as they join. You can 
        edit anytime and will get help from Clewed in finalizing your topic and selecting a moderator as needed.</p>

    <p>To be approved, all information must be clearly and professionally presented. 
        You cannot include your brand name, market any outside business or add links to your own website.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Lato Black;margin-bottom: 16px;color:#00A3BF">2. Invite People</p>

    <p>Once your offer is approved, begin sharing it. Use your unique affiliate code found in your 
        profile “Edit” section, to invite people. Spread the word across social media using the 
        tools available in the About page of your Insight’s public url. Your goal, especially 
        in the beginning, should be to build audience. People who attend one of topics usually buy more, 
        request your services and invite friends.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Lato Black;margin-bottom: 16px;color:#00A3BF">3. Connect and Deliver</p>

    <p>As soon as your topic is approved, its url is accessible publicly. Interested parties can buy, access your materials, 
        and engage online. The quality of the visual aid you upload and the“About” content defining your offer are key in 
        ensuring high participation and satisfaction. Clewed will help find a moderator, add a call-in number to 
        facilitate a live discussion, and add notes and recording post the live session for Insights. 
        For services, you will have time to collect buyer information and clarify deliverables after the purchase. </p>

    <p style="font-family: Lato Black;margin-bottom: 16px;color:#00A3BF">4. Earn Revenues</p>

    <p>You set the price for each of your offers. For audience you bring to your Insights, you take 
        100% of the revenue less moderator and third party payment processing fees. For audience we 
        bring to you, you take 50% less moderator and payment processing fees. </p>
    <p>For Services, you keep 80% of each transaction. </p>

    <p style="font-family: Lato Black;margin-bottom: 16px;color:#00A3BF">5. Be Successful</p>

    <p>Your goal, just like ours, should be to create high-quality actionable content and drive volume.

        faster in business. We work to help you build ongoing relationships that gives you a platform to

        on your own.</p>
